Computer has 2 components:
Bare Metal or Hard Ware:
	- RAM: Memory
	- CPU:
	- ROM: hard disk
	- MOUSE
	- Keyboard: 
Software components:
	- Operating system: OS like windows, Linux, MacOS etc
Other software's:
	- Shell
	- Sublime
	- Microsoft word/Excel: 
	- These are other software's that you can install. 
	- If you want to run tasks on your computer you have to either use the GUI (graphical user interface) or the CLI (Command line interface) using a shell. 
	- A server is a super computer that does multiple things

WHAT IS A SHELL SCRIPT
	- A shell script is a collection of commands in a file
	- A shell is an interpreter
	- A shell is a program that takes command from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform
	- On most Linux systems a program called bash ( which stands for Bourne Again Shell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh) acts as the shell program. Besides bourne shell, there are other shell programs that can be installed in a Linux system. These include Korn Shell, Boune shell (bash) and C shell. 
	- To see the shells that you have in your system you run cat /etc/shells
	ec2-user@ip-172-31-77-155 ~]$ cat /etc/shells
	/bin/sh
	/bin/bash
	/usr/bin/sh
	/usr/bin/bash
	- The above output tells me that I have sh which is the bourne shell and bash which is the bourne again shell. 
	- The command echo $SHELL tells you which shell will be interpreting your commands 
Naming convention:
	- The shell script is recommended to end in .sh or .sc example will be deploy.sh
	- The shell script ALWAYS start with #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash
	- You can also do the above with usr/bin

How to run a shell script
	- ./script name
	- Example is ./deploy.sh
	- If you run the shell script without giving the script any permissions you get a permission deny. So the above command will give a permission denied because the file does not have executable permissions. 
	- To assign permissions to a file we use the chmod command. Which is chmod +x scriptname
	- +x means add executable permissions. +r means add read permissions and +w means add write permissions. 
	- After running the executable permissions the color of the file changes color.
	- To get the date in a shell script the date has to be inputted as `date`. This provides you with the date of that particular day
	- For a command to run as a command in shell scripting the command has to be run in back tic as seen above with the date command.``
	- To remove the executable permissions in a file you run the command chmod -x filename
	- We can also run a file without executable permissions
	- You can also run a script without the #! Option. However, it is best practice to run it with that option
	- To run a script without executable permissions simply run as sh filename or bash filename
	- This is because these are the interpreters
	- You can install other interpreters such as c shell and k shell by running sudo yum install csh or sudo yum install ksh
	- Then to see what shells are running you run cat /etc/shells

What are comments:
	- Metadata is data about data
	- Explains what the script is achieving and used to explain the script file
	- Single line comment vs multi line comment
	- The comments have to start with #
	- Multi line comments in shell starts with <<mlc and ends with mlc wher mlc is a variable that can be changed based on the user
	- Sudo yum list installed to find the packages installed and sudo yum search packagename to find package names you are trying to install. For example sudo yum search awscl* to find packages for the awscli to install
	- The multi-line comment prevents you from inputting the # sign multiple times.
	- You are able to run scripts providing the absolute path as well if the script is being run from a different location

What are variables in Linux:
	- Company = LandmarkTechnology
	- Echo $Company
	- The dollar sign in front of company tells me that company is a variable
	- We will create a variable file called var.sh which is a variable file
	- When it comes to variables we have system defined variables and user defined variables
	- In the above example PWD is a system defined variable and the other variables like name and company are user defined variables
	- Env helps list all your environmental variables
	- All system variables are in caps so it is not recommended for user variables to be in caps as well. This is to avoid a conflict with any system variables available with the same name
	- To refresh a variable file you run source plus variable file
	- This updates the file after any changes are made
	- The read pin command in Linux allows the user to dynamically enter a pin
	- The read command in this case allows the user to be able to enter a value for the system
	- The pin in this case is a dynamic variable
    
Bash scripting class 3
	- Helping clients to transition from manual operations to automation
	- Rather than running individual commands we will put them in a file to automate the process
	- The echo can be run with or without the quotes
	- To run a dynamic variable we are going to use the read command
	- Scripting is very important for automation
	- The read command helps to obtain dynamic variables
	- Writing variables like the one in whatsapp.sh is called hard coding which is not recommended in software development
	[ec2-user@ip-172-31-77-155 ~]$ cat whatsapp.sh
	#!/bin/bash
	firstname=brigthain
	lastname=kargong
	echo "Thanks $firstname $lastname for installing whatsapp"
	echo "Please enter your phone number to receive your pin"
	read number
	echo "confirm if this $number is correct"
	read
	- First and last name above have been hard coded
	- We had a meeting with the team to avoid hard coding
	- Always try to make use of comments when writing scripts in your environment
	- The script below helps create a user account in your environment
	!/bin/bash
	#You need to be root or have sudo access to execute this script
	#This script will create a new user's account in a linux server
	echo "Please enter the userName for the account you want to create!"
	read userName
	echo "The name you entered is: $userName"
	sudo useradd $userName
	echo "$userName user account created successfully"
	echo "Set the password for $userName"
	sudo passwd $userName
	- The | command acts as a temporary storage and grep will only extract the word you provide
	- Read -s allows you to provide any information as a secret
	[ec2-user@ip-172-31-77-155 ~]$ cat read-user2.sh
	
	#!/bin/sh
	#You need to be root or have sudo access to execute this script
	echo -n "Enter the username: "
	read username
	echo -n "Enter the password:"
	read -s password
	sudo adduser "$username"
	echo "$password" | sudo passwd "$username" --stdin
	tail -7 /etc/passwd
	<<ST
	    stdin: This option is used to indicate that the passwd should read the new password from standard input, which can be a pipe.
	you can cat /etc/passwd to verify
	ST
	- https://www.howtogeek.com/435903/what-are-stdin-stdout-and-stderr-on-linux/
	- View link above to lear about stdin, stdout,stderror
	- Python scripts end in .py
	- Echo is to bash shell scripting as print is to python
	- Multi line code for python looks like '' and ''
	- To run a command in python type print('Input phrase here')
	#!/bin/sh
	#You need to be root or have sudo access to execute this script
	#This script also adds the user to the sudoers file for root privilges
	echo -n "Enter the username: "
	read username
	echo -n "Enter the password:"
	read -s password
	sudo adduser "$username"
	echo "$password" | sudo passwd "$username" --stdin
	echo "$username  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/$username
	tail -7 /etc/passwd
	<<ST
	    stdin: This option is used to indicate that the passwd should read the new password from standard input, which can be a pipe.
	you can cat /etc/passwd to verify
	ST
	
	Number and String variables
	- An example of a string variable is str1="My name is Brigthain kargong and I work for gainwelltechnologies"
	- Most string variables should either be in single or double quotes
	- Number variable is num=5
	- The expression command in Linux lets you output values on your CLI
	- For instance expr 4+5 gives you 9
	- Or we can also use variables in bash shell scripting to create your own calculator
		#!/bin/bash
	echo "Please enter the first number"
	read num1
	echo "Please enter the second number"
	read num2
	echo "The sum is"
	expr $num1 + num2
	echo "The difference is `expr $num1 - $num2`
	echo "The product is `expr $num1 \* $num2`
	- The backtick is used here so that that portion will be run as a command

Command line arguments:
	- These are very important in bash shell scripting. These tell you what is happening when you run a script
	- The command line arguments to make note of are
	- Echo '$#:' -> number of arguments
	- , echo '$$:',-> a process ID
	-  echo '$0:',-> ScriptName
	-  echo '$*:', : Display all arguments
	- echo '$@:',: Display all the arguments
	-  echo '$?:': Status of the last run command
	- Any command you run in Linux created a process ID. 
	- Arg1 is the first argument. If you run the command cla.sh arg1 db app lb. The arg1 db app and lb in this case are all the arguments and app is the 3rd argument
	- Echo $?: has value either 0 or 1-127
	- Echo $?: 0 means you are good to go. If its nor zero it means there's a problem
	- For echo $? You get an error of 127 when there's a command not found error and value of 1 when there's a no such file or directory
	- This basically gives us the status of the last run command. If the comma d was fine the value will be a zero and if it was an error it will have a value ranging from 1-127
